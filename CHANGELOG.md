## Development History

### 2025-08-30 - Phase 2 Completed: Prompt Upsampling Feature
**Implementation Summary:**
Successfully implemented decoupled prompt upsampling that works with high-resolution videos by preprocessing them to avoid vocab out of range errors.

**Core Components Added:**
1. **Scripts:**
   - `scripts/upsample_prompts.py` - Python batch upsampling with video preprocessing
   - `scripts/upsample_prompt.sh` - Bash wrapper for Docker execution

2. **WorkflowOrchestrator Integration:**
   - `cosmos_workflow/workflows/upsample_integration.py` - UpsampleWorkflowMixin
   - Three main methods: batch, single, and directory upsampling
   - Full SSH/Docker/FileTransfer integration

3. **CLI Command:**
   - `python -m cosmos_workflow.main upsample <input> [options]`
   - Supports single files and directories
   - Video preprocessing options (resolution, frames)
   - GPU configuration

4. **Test Coverage:**
   - `tests/test_upsample_prompts.py` - 8 unit tests (all passing)
   - Tests cover: video preprocessing, batch processing, error handling, CLI parsing

**Key Features:**
- Batch processing with model persistence for efficiency
- Video resolution downsampling (480p default) to avoid errors
- Frame reduction options (2 frames default)
- PromptSpecs with `upsampled=true` flag and original prompt stored
- Memory optimization with `--offload_prompt_upsampler` flag

**Outstanding Tasks:**
- Fix integration tests API mismatches
- Add end-to-end tests with mocked SSH/Docker

### 2025-08-29 - Phase 1 Completed: System Refactoring
**Implementation Summary:**
Complete modernization from bash scripts to Python orchestration with TOML configuration, comprehensive testing, and schema-based prompt management.

**Major Changes:**
- Migrated from bash scripts to Python orchestration
- Converted config from shell to TOML format
- Added comprehensive pytest test suite (3,264+ lines)
- Implemented modern schema-based prompt system (PromptSpec/RunSpec separation)
- Date-organized directory structure with hash-based IDs

## Planned Development Phases

### Phase 3: Add Batch Inference Support (Not Started)
**Goal**: Enable processing multiple PromptSpecs in a single inference run.

**Requirements:**
- Support Cosmos Transfer's batch inference options
