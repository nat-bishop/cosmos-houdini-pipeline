The video captures a game playing, with bad crappy graphics and \
cartoonish frames. It represents a recording of old outdated games. \
The lighting looks very fake. The textures are very raw and basic. \
The geometries are very primitive. The images are very pixelated and \
of poor CG quality. There are many subtitles in the footage. \
Overall, the video is unrealistic at all.\
