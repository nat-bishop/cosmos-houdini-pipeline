# README Update Rule

When making changes to scripts, code, or configuration that affect the high-level functionality of the system, always update the README.md file to reflect those changes.

## What to update:

- **Script functionality changes**: New command-line options, new scripts, or changes to existing script behavior
- **Configuration changes**: Updates to config.sh or other configuration files that affect how the system works
- **File structure changes**: Changes to input/output directories, file naming conventions, or directory layouts
- **API changes**: Changes to JSON formats, command-line arguments, or other interfaces
- **New features**: Additional capabilities or options that users need to know about

## Examples:

- Adding new flags to scripts (like `--duplicate` to new_prompt.sh)
- Changing default paths or directory structures
- Modifying JSON schema or file formats
- Adding new automation scripts
- Updating Docker mount configurations

## How to update:

1. Update the relevant sections of README.md
2. Ensure examples and usage instructions are current
3. Update any file path references or directory structures
4. Add documentation for new features or options
5. Keep the "Example: End-to-End Run" section current

This ensures that users can always understand how to use the system based on the current codebase.
