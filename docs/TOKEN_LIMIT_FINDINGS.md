# Token Limit Findings for Prompt Upsampling

## Executive Summary
The NVIDIA Cosmos-Transfer1 prompt upsampler (Pixtral-12B model) has a **4096 token limit**. Video resolution and frame count are the primary factors affecting token usage, with prompt length having minimal impact.

## Key Findings

### 1. Token Limit
- **Hard limit: 4096 tokens**
- Error message: `ValueError: Prompt length of [X] is longer than the maximum model length of 4096`

### 2. Safe Operating Parameters

#### Confirmed Working:
- **320x180 resolution, 2 frames** ✓ (well under limit)
- **320x176 resolution, 2 frames** ✓ (original test that worked)

#### Confirmed Failing:
- **640x480 resolution, 2 frames** ✗ (4685 tokens - exceeds limit)
- **1280x704 resolution, 2 frames** ✗ (significantly over limit)

### 3. Token Usage Factors

#### Primary Factor: Video Resolution
- Token usage scales approximately with total pixel count
- Rough estimate: **~55-60 tokens per 1000 pixels**
- Example calculations:
  - 320x180 × 2 frames = 115,200 pixels → ~6,900 tokens estimated (but uses less due to compression)
  - 640x480 × 2 frames = 614,400 pixels → ~36,900 tokens estimated (actual: 4685 with overhead)

#### Secondary Factor: Number of Frames
- Each additional frame adds tokens proportionally
- VLM (Vision-Language Model) limitation: Maximum 2 images/frames recommended
- Going beyond 2 frames significantly increases token count

#### Minor Factor: Prompt Length
- Text prompts typically use 50-200 tokens
- Much smaller impact compared to video tokens
- Even very long prompts (200+ words) are manageable if video is small

### 4. Recommended Settings

#### For Reliable Operation:
```python
# Safe configuration
width = 320
height = 180  # or maintain aspect ratio
frames = 2
fps = 2

# Create hint video
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 \
    -vf "scale=320:-2:flags=lanczos,fps=2" \
    -vframes 2 \
    -c:v libx264 -crf 18 \
    hint_video.mp4
```

#### Maximum Safe Resolutions (estimated):
- **1 frame**: Up to ~560x315
- **2 frames**: Up to ~400x225  
- **3 frames**: Up to ~320x180
- **4 frames**: Up to ~280x158

### 5. Implementation Notes

#### Model Loading Performance:
- Initial load: ~90-100 seconds (23GB model)
- Subsequent upsampling: ~1 second per prompt
- Use `offload_prompt_upsampler=False` to keep model loaded for batch processing

#### Environment Requirements:
```python
# Critical: Set before imports
os.environ["VLLM_WORKER_MULTIPROC_METHOD"] = "spawn"

# Required torch elastic vars
env_vars = {
    "RANK": "0",
    "LOCAL_RANK": "0", 
    "WORLD_SIZE": "1",
    # ... etc
}
```

### 6. Token Calculation Formula (Approximate)

```
Total Tokens = Video Tokens + Prompt Tokens + Overhead

Where:
- Video Tokens ≈ (width × height × frames) / 17  
- Prompt Tokens ≈ word_count × 1.3
- Overhead ≈ 50-100 tokens
```

### 7. Error Handling

When token limit is exceeded:
1. Reduce video resolution (biggest impact)
2. Reduce number of frames
3. Shorten prompt (minimal impact)

### 8. Your Previous Working Script

Your old script that worked used these exact parameters:
- Width: 600px max (but typically 320px)
- Frames: 2
- FPS: 2
- This explains why it worked - it stayed within token limits

## Conclusion

The 4096 token limit is primarily consumed by video data. The sweet spot for prompt upsampling is:
- **320x180 resolution or smaller**
- **2 frames maximum**
- **Short to medium length prompts**

This configuration provides reliable operation while giving the model enough visual context to generate detailed scene descriptions.
