    "upsampled_prompt": "The video features a series of frames that focus on the architectural details of a building's facade. The sunlight casts a warm glow on the building, highlighting the intricate patterns and textures of the windows and the surrounding structures. The windows are rectangular with a grid-like pattern, and the building's exterior is a mix of what appears to be stone and metal. The sunlight creates a contrast between the brightly lit areas and the shadows, emphasizing the depth and dimension of the building's features.",
