# Linting and Code Quality Setup

## Overview
Your project now has a modern, comprehensive linting and code quality setup using the latest Python tooling best practices.

## üîß Tools Installed

### 1. **Ruff** (v0.12.11)
- **Purpose**: Fast, all-in-one Python linter and formatter
- **Replaces**: flake8, isort, black, pylint, and many other tools
- **Benefits**: 
  - 10-100x faster than traditional tools
  - Single configuration in `pyproject.toml`
  - Automatic fixing capability
  - Comprehensive rule set

### 2. **MyPy** (v1.17.1)
- **Purpose**: Static type checking
- **Features**: Catches type-related bugs before runtime
- **Configuration**: Lenient settings to start, can be made stricter

### 3. **Bandit** (v1.8.6)
- **Purpose**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Features**: Detects common security issues in Python code

### 4. **Safety** (v3.6.0)
- **Purpose**: Checks dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Features**: Scans your installed packages against CVE database

### 5. **Pre-commit** (v4.3.0)
- **Purpose**: Automated checks before commits
- **Features**: Runs all tools automatically on git commit

## üìÅ Configuration Files

### Modified/Created:
- `pyproject.toml` - Central configuration for all tools
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hook configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Core dependencies only
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies
- `Makefile` - Convenient commands for all operations
- `lint.py` - Quick linting test script

### Removed (replaced by Ruff):
- `.flake8` - No longer needed

## üöÄ Usage

### Quick Commands (via Makefile):
```bash
make lint          # Run all linting checks
make format        # Auto-format code
make security      # Run security scans
make test          # Run tests with coverage
make clean         # Clean cache files
make check-all     # Run all checks
```

### Direct Tool Usage:
```bash
# Linting
ruff check cosmos_workflow/              # Check for issues
ruff check cosmos_workflow/ --fix        # Auto-fix issues
ruff format cosmos_workflow/             # Format code

# Type checking
mypy cosmos_workflow/

# Security
bandit -r cosmos_workflow/
safety check

# Pre-commit
pre-commit run --all-files              # Run on all files
pre-commit install                      # Install git hooks
```

## üéØ Key Improvements

### 1. **Unified Tooling**
- Replaced 5+ separate tools (black, isort, flake8, etc.) with Ruff
- Single source of truth for configuration
- Consistent formatting and linting rules

### 2. **Modern Standards**
- Using latest versions of all tools
- Python 3.10+ syntax support
- Comprehensive rule coverage including:
  - Code style (E, W)
  - Logic errors (F)
  - Security issues (S)
  - Performance (PERF)
  - Type checking (TCH)
  - Simplification (SIM)
  - And many more...

### 3. **Security Focus**
- Bandit for code security scanning
- Safety for dependency vulnerability checking
- Pre-commit hooks to catch secrets

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Fast feedback (Ruff is 10-100x faster)
- Automatic fixing where possible
- Clear error messages
- IDE integration ready

## üìä Current Status

### Issues Found (as of setup):
- ~200 linting issues (most auto-fixable)
- 16 critical errors (E/W/F categories)
- Most common:
  - Line length violations (E501)
  - Import organization (can be auto-fixed)
  - Missing type hints (gradual typing enabled)
  - F-string in logging (G004)

### Recommendations:
1. Run `ruff check --fix cosmos_workflow/` to auto-fix most issues
2. Gradually address remaining issues
3. Consider enabling stricter rules over time
4. Set up CI/CD to enforce standards

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:
```bash
# Update pre-commit hooks monthly
pre-commit autoupdate

# Check for security updates
safety check

# Update dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Progressive Enhancement:
1. Start with current lenient settings
2. Fix existing issues gradually
3. Enable stricter rules as codebase improves
4. Add more specialized tools as needed

## üéì Benefits for Solo Development

1. **Consistency**: Code stays consistent even working alone
2. **Learning**: Tools teach best practices through feedback
3. **Safety**: Catch bugs and security issues early
4. **Professionalism**: Industry-standard setup
5. **Future-proofing**: Easy to onboard contributors later
6. **IDE Support**: Most IDEs integrate with these tools

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Run `ruff check --fix cosmos_workflow/` to fix easy issues
2. **Short-term**: Address remaining linting issues
3. **Medium-term**: Enable stricter type checking with MyPy
4. **Long-term**: Add more quality checks as needed

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If pre-commit is slow:
```bash
pre-commit clean
pre-commit install
```

### If tools conflict:
- Ruff takes precedence (it replaces many tools)
- Check `pyproject.toml` for configuration
- Disable conflicting tools in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

### For Windows-specific issues:
- Use `python -m <tool>` instead of direct commands
- Check line endings (should be LF, not CRLF)
