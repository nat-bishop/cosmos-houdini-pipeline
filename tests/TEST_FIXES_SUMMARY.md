# Test Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. Fixed Import Issues
- **test_workflow_orchestration.py**: Changed `FileTransferManager` ‚Üí `FileTransferService`
- **test_performance.py**: Replaced `FakeWorkflowOrchestrator` with real `WorkflowOrchestrator` + mocks

### 2. Fixed Tests Using Fakes
Found and fixed tests that were using fakes of our own code:
- **test_performance.py**: Now uses real orchestrator with mocked externals
- Tests will now actually measure performance of real code

## ‚ùå Remaining Issues

### 1. Schema Changes
The codebase has evolved and schemas have changed:
- `RunSpec.prompt_spec_id` ‚Üí `RunSpec.prompt_id`
- `RunSpec` now requires a `name` field
- These need to be fixed in `conftest.py`

### 2. Initialization Changes
- `WorkflowOrchestrator` now takes config file path, not config manager
- Already partially fixed but may need more adjustments

## üìã Tests Status

### Problematic Tests Found:
1. **tests/performance/test_gpu_and_perf.py** - Was using `FakeWorkflowOrchestrator` ‚úÖ FIXED
2. **tests/properties/test_invariants.py** - Uses `FakePromptSpec` (less critical, property test)
3. **tests/integration/test_workflow_orchestration.py** - Import issues ‚úÖ FIXED
4. **tests/integration/test_sftp_workflow.py** - Reverted to original
5. **tests/unit/execution/test_docker_executor.py** - Reverted to original

## üîß What Still Needs Fixing

### conftest.py Schema Updates
```python
# OLD (doesn't work):
RunSpec(prompt_spec_id=...) 

# NEW (correct):
RunSpec(prompt_id=..., name=...)
```

### Properties Test (Lower Priority)
The properties test using `FakePromptSpec` is less critical because:
- It's testing mathematical properties, not business logic
- The fake is just holding test data

## üí° Key Insight

The tests were failing not because the approach was wrong, but because:
1. We were testing fakes instead of real code (now fixed)
2. The codebase evolved and tests weren't updated (schemas changed)

## Next Steps

To get tests fully working:
1. Update `conftest.py` to use correct RunSpec schema
2. Fix any remaining schema mismatches
3. Consider if properties test needs fixing (probably not critical)

The important fix is done: **tests now use real implementations with mocked boundaries**, so they'll actually catch bugs in your code.
