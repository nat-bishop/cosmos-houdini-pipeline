# SIMPLE Pre-commit Configuration
# Focus: Code quality without over-engineering

repos:
  # 1. Basic file hygiene (fast, non-controversial)
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v5.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-json
      - id: check-merge-conflict
      - id: detect-private-key
      - id: check-added-large-files
        args: ['--maxkb=1000']

  # 2. Python formatting and linting (Ruff = all-in-one)
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.8.4
    hooks:
      - id: ruff         # Linting
        args: [--fix]
      - id: ruff-format  # Formatting

# That's it! Just 9 hooks that:
# - Keep files clean
# - Format code consistently
# - Catch basic issues
# - Run fast

# Optional additions (add if needed):
# - mypy for type checking (but fix types first)
# - pytest for critical tests (but only on push, not commit)

# Removed because overengineered:
# - Print statement checking (too many false positives)
# - Test naming enforcement (pedantic)
# - Safety/Bandit (dependency issues, run in CI instead)
# - PyUpgrade (nice-to-have, not essential)
# - Spell checking (noisy)
# - Local regex hooks (maintenance burden)
