# Phase 2: Mock Reduction Summary
*Completed: 2025-08-31*

## Overview
Successfully reduced mock usage in the test suite by creating test doubles and focusing on behavioral testing instead of implementation details.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Test Doubles (`tests/test_doubles.py`)
Created fake implementations for external dependencies:
- **FakeSSHManager**: Simulates SSH operations without network
- **FakeFileTransferService**: Simulates SFTP operations
- **FakeDockerExecutor**: Simulates container operations
- **FakePromptSpecManager**: In-memory prompt management
- **FakeWorkflowOrchestrator**: Simplified orchestrator for testing

These fakes provide realistic behavior without external dependencies, making tests more reliable and meaningful.

### 2. Fixed Schema Issues
- ✅ Changed `prompt_spec_id` → `prompt_id` in all RunSpec instances
- ✅ Added required `name` field to RunSpec
- ✅ Changed string `execution_status` to `ExecutionStatus` enum
- ✅ Fixed `guidance_scale` → `guidance` parameter name
- ✅ Added optional fields to PromptSpec fixtures

### 3. Removed Non-Existent Method Mocks
Identified and removed mocks for methods that don't exist:
- ❌ `PromptSpecManager.load_by_id()` - doesn't exist
- ❌ `WorkflowOrchestrator._generate_control_spec()` - doesn't exist
- ❌ `WorkflowOrchestrator.check_status()` - actually `check_remote_status()`

### 4. Created Behavioral Tests
New test files focus on behavior instead of implementation:
- `test_workflow_orchestration_simple.py`: Tests schema integration and behavior
- `test_workflow_orchestration_refactored.py`: Refactored tests with test doubles

## Results

### Before (Over-Mocked)
```python
# Tests that passed even with broken code
with patch("cosmos_workflow.prompts.prompt_spec_manager.PromptSpecManager.load_by_id"):
    with patch.object(orchestrator, 'ssh_manager'):
        with patch.object(orchestrator, 'docker_executor'):
            # Only tested that methods were called, not actual behavior
            orchestrator.run_inference(spec)
            mock.assert_called_once()  # Meaningless test
```

### After (Properly Tested)
```python
# Tests that verify actual behavior
fake_ssh = FakeSSHManager()
orchestrator.ssh_manager = fake_ssh  # Only mock external boundary

result = orchestrator.run_inference(spec)
assert result is True  # Test outcome
assert len(fake_ssh.commands_executed) > 0  # Verify behavior
```

## Test Results

### Unit Tests (Schemas)
- **133/133 tests passing** ✅
- All schema tests work with new field names
- Proper enum usage validated

### Integration Tests
- **Simple behavioral tests**: 4/4 passing ✅
- Tests now verify actual behavior instead of method calls
- No longer dependent on internal implementation details

## Key Improvements

1. **Real Coverage**: Tests now exercise real code paths instead of mocked ones
2. **Behavior Focus**: Tests verify outcomes, not implementation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to internal methods won't break tests
4. **Reliability**: Tests catch actual bugs instead of passing with broken code
5. **Speed**: Test doubles are faster than complex mock setups

## Remaining Issues

Some integration tests still fail due to:
1. Tests assuming internal methods that were removed/refactored
2. Path construction issues on Windows
3. Missing attributes on actual objects

These are not schema issues but rather tests that need updating to match the current codebase structure.

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Coverage Improvement
Focus on improving coverage for critical components:
- `smart_naming.py` (8.20% → 80%)
- `prompt_manager.py` (12.90% → 85%)
- `workflow_orchestrator.py` (13.66% → 90%)

### Recommendations

1. **Continue replacing mocks with fakes** for remaining test files
2. **Add contract tests** at system boundaries
3. **Write behavior-driven tests** for uncovered code
4. **Remove tests for internal implementation details**

## Lessons Learned

1. **Mock at boundaries only**: Only mock external systems (SSH, Docker, network)
2. **Test doubles > Mocks**: Fakes provide better testing than mocks
3. **Behavior > Implementation**: Test what code does, not how it does it
4. **Real objects > Mocked objects**: Use real implementations whenever possible

## Files Modified

- `tests/conftest.py` - Fixed all fixtures
- `tests/integration/test_workflow_orchestration.py` - Fixed inline schemas
- `tests/test_doubles.py` - Created test doubles (NEW)
- `tests/integration/test_workflow_orchestration_simple.py` - Behavioral tests (NEW)
- `tests/integration/test_workflow_orchestration_refactored.py` - Refactored with fakes (NEW)

## Time Spent

- Phase 1 (Schema fixes): ~30 minutes
- Phase 2 (Mock reduction): ~45 minutes
- Total: ~1.25 hours

This completes Phase 2 of the test suite fix plan. The foundation is now solid for Phase 3 (Coverage Improvement).
