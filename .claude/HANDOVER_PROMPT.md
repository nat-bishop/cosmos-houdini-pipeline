# Cosmos Workflow Manager UI - Session Handover

Please thoroughly review the UI improvement plan located at `.claude/UI_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` before proceeding with any implementation.

## Context
You're continuing work on the Cosmos Workflow Manager UI improvements. Several tasks have been completed (removing Select All button, applying consistent styling to Input Details, and partially removing model_type references). The remaining tasks are documented in the plan.

## Key Implementation Guidelines

### Testing Requirements
- Test EVERY change with Playwright browser automation
- Verify functionality works as expected before moving to the next task
- Commit changes frequently after each successful test
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_*` tools for testing

### Technical Principles
- **Use CosmosAPI exclusively** - Never access the database directly, always use the CosmosAPI methods (get_prompt, list_runs, get_run, preview_run_delete, run_delete, etc.)
- **Avoid code duplication** - Reuse existing functions and components where possible
- **Follow existing patterns** - Match the code style and patterns already established in the codebase

### Design Principles
- **Visual Consistency**: Ensure all detail sections use the same structured textbox field styling
- **Hierarchy & Contrast**: Use visual weight and color to guide user attention
- **Micro-interactions**: Add hover states, smooth transitions, and loading indicators
- **User Safety**: Implement clear warnings and confirmations for all destructive actions (deletions)

### Priority Tasks
1. Complete the model_type removal from UI components
2. Add enhanced status indicator to Prompt Details
3. Combine and style Input Details with Video Previews
4. Redesign Output Details for better inputâ†’output visualization
5. Create the Run History tab with full run information
6. Implement deletion features with proper warnings using preview_run_delete and run_delete

### Quality Standards
- Don't hold back - give it your all
- Think deeply about user experience and visual design
- Apply professional design principles (hierarchy, contrast, balance, movement)
- Create an impressive demonstration of web development capabilities
- Analyze your results after each step to ensure correctness

Remember: The goal is to create a polished, professional UI that makes it easy to manage Cosmos Transfer workflows, view results, and make decisions based on inference outputs.
