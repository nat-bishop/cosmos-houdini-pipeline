The scene unfolds on a quiet city street where skyscrapers lean and crumble, their fractured steel skeletons jutting skyward. Warm morning light spills between the ruins, casting long, golden beams across the cracked asphalt. Dust hangs in the air, glowing softly as if illuminated by hope itself. Vegetation creeps along the wreckage, small green shoots breaking through fissures in the pavement. A broken traffic light dangles, swaying faintly in the breeze. The collapsed towers loom on either side, but the soft dawn light lends the devastation a strangely peaceful quality, evoking resilience amid destruction.
