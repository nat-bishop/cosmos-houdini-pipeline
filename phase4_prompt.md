# Phase 4 Implementation Request - Log Visualization Interface

## Context
Phase 3 of the logging infrastructure has been successfully completed. The codebase now has:
- Efficient remote log streaming with seek-based position tracking (RemoteLogStreamer)
- Integration with DockerExecutor for real-time log monitoring
- Comprehensive test coverage with 22 tests
- Full documentation and CHANGELOG updates

## Your Task
Please implement **Phase 4: Log Visualization Interface** from the logging infrastructure plan located at `docs/logging-infrastructure-implementation-plan.md`.

## Critical Requirements

### 1. Deep Analysis Before Implementation
Before writing any code, you must:
- Read and thoroughly understand the Phase 4 requirements in the implementation plan
- Analyze existing codebase patterns for UI/visualization components
- Identify all dependencies and integration points
- Consider edge cases and failure modes
- Plan the complete testing strategy

### 2. Strict TDD Workflow (CLAUDE.md Gates)
You MUST follow the TDD gates defined in CLAUDE.md:

**Gate 1 - Write Tests First**
- Test BEHAVIOR, not implementation
- Add sufficient test cases to force generalization
- Include happy path, boundaries, and error paths
- Use our wrappers (no third-party mocking)
- Tests must fail initially

**Gate 2 - Verify Tests Fail**
- Run pytest on new/modified tests only
- Confirm they fail as expected
- Verify no existing tests were modified

**Gate 3 - Commit Failing Tests**
- Tests are the contract - commit unchanged

**Gate 4 - Make Tests Pass**
- Write minimal code to pass tests
- DO NOT modify tests from Gate 3
- **MUST run overfit-verifier agent** before proceeding
- Verify both pytest and overfit-verifier pass

**Gate 5 - Document**
- Update README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/
- Use doc-drafter agent for consistency

**Gate 6 - Review**
- Run code-reviewer agent
- Run ruff check and pytest --cov in parallel
- Ensure coverage >= 80%

### 3. Phase 4 Specific Requirements
Based on the implementation plan, Phase 4 should include:

1. **Web-based log viewer component**
   - Real-time log display with auto-refresh
   - Search and filter capabilities
   - Syntax highlighting for different log levels
   - Performance optimization for large logs

2. **Integration with existing monitoring**
   - Connect to RemoteLogStreamer output
   - Support multiple concurrent log streams
   - Maintain position tracking for efficiency

3. **User Interface considerations**
   - Responsive design
   - Dark/light theme support if applicable
   - Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
   - Export functionality

### 4. Problem-Solving Approach
For each component:
1. **Think deeply** about the problem domain
2. Research existing patterns in the codebase
3. Design for testability and maintainability
4. Consider performance implications
5. Plan for error scenarios

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for log streaming connection
- UI/UX tests if applicable
- Performance tests for large log files
- Cross-browser compatibility if web-based

### 6. Best Practices from CLAUDE.md
- Use project wrappers exclusively (no raw libraries)
- Path operations: Path(a) / b
- Parameterized logging: logger.info("%s", var)
- Type hints required for all public functions
- Google-style docstrings
- Catch specific exceptions only
- ASCII only in code/logs
- Small functions with single responsibility

### 7. Verification Checklist
Before considering Phase 4 complete:
- [ ] All 6 TDD gates satisfied
- [ ] Wrappers used exclusively
- [ ] No modifications to Gate 3 tests
- [ ] Ruff clean
- [ ] Coverage >= 80%
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No secrets in code/logs
- [ ] Temp files cleaned up
- [ ] Overfit-verifier confirmed no overfitting
- [ ] Code-reviewer approved implementation

## Important Notes
1. **No assumptions** - verify everything in the codebase
2. **Test-first** - never write implementation before tests
3. **Use agents** - overfit-verifier, doc-drafter, code-reviewer
4. **Follow wrappers** - extend wrappers if needed, never bypass
5. **Think deeply** - analyze each problem thoroughly before coding

## Expected Deliverables
1. Web-based log visualization interface
2. Full test suite with >80% coverage
3. Updated documentation
4. Integration with existing RemoteLogStreamer
5. Performance optimizations for large logs
6. Clean commit history following TDD gates

Please begin by reading the Phase 4 requirements in `docs/logging-infrastructure-implementation-plan.md` and analyzing the codebase for existing UI/visualization patterns. Think deeply about each component before implementation and follow the TDD workflow strictly.

Remember: The quality of the implementation depends on the depth of your initial analysis and strict adherence to TDD principles.
