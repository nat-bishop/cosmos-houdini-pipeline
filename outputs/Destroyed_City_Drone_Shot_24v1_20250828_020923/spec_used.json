  "prompt": "The street lies in near-total darkness, framed by collapsed skyscrapers that loom like vast, broken tombstones. The cracked pavement gleams faintly under a pale moon, its light fractured by drifting clouds. Cold mist coils at ground level, winding around toppled street signs and abandoned vehicles half-buried in rubble. In the distance, the hollow echo of dripping water reverberates through the ruins. A single flicker of light from a dangling electrical wire sparks and fades, swallowed by the night. The scene feels ghostly and desolate, every detail soaked in a sense of haunting stillness.",
