At street level, the fractured skeletons of fallen skyscrapers cast enormous shadows across the empty boulevard. The last rays of evening sun ignite the dust in the air, painting the ruins in hues of deep orange and crimson. Shattered windows glint like dying embers, while the broken facades stand jagged and foreboding against the sky. Streetlamps long dead rise like thin gravestones among the rubble. The scene has the quiet grandeur of a battlefield after the fighting has ceasedâ€”ominous and cinematic, as though the ruins are holding their breath for nightfall.
