## Ready for Merge

### Prerequisites Met
✅ All tests passing
✅ No failing pre-commit hooks
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Coverage improved significantly
✅ Merge strategy documented

### Merge Readiness
- **Branch**: feature/parallel-development
- **Target**: main
- **Conflicts Expected**: Minimal (mostly in test files)
- **Strategy**: Rebase recommended (see MERGE_STRATEGY_PLAN.md)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete work in other session** and commit
2. **Create backup branches** for safety
3. **Execute merge** following the strategy plan
4. **Verify** all tests still pass post-merge
5. **Create PR** to main with comprehensive description

## Value Added

This branch significantly improves the project's:
- **Reliability**: Full test coverage, no failures
- **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and test structure
- **Professional Quality**: Production-ready test suite
- **Developer Experience**: Fast, reliable tests with good mocking

The test improvements alone make this a critical merge for project stability.
