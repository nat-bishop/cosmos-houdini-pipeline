The ruined street is shrouded beneath a bruised gray sky, where lightning forks violently between skeletal remains of fallen skyscrapers. Rain pelts the cracked asphalt, forming slick pools that mirror the devastation. Broken glass scatters like glitter across the wet ground, flashing with each lightning strike. Wind howls through the shattered steel frames, producing a mournful wail that echoes down the boulevard. Debris shifts and clatters with every gust, suggesting instability and danger. The storm amplifies the chaos of the collapsed city, immersing the scene in restless energy and raw, cinematic intensity.
